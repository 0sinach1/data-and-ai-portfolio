## Problem Statement🤔

*Businesses often struggle to understand how sales and inventory behave over time, leading to poor stock planning, missed opportunities, and revenue loss. This project analyzes retail sales data to identify demand patterns, seasonal trends, and sales inconsistencies over monthly periods. The goal is to understand how sales evolve over time and provide data-driven insights that support better inventory planning and decision-making.*       

## Data Structure💻

**The dataset contains transactional retail sales data with the following key attributes:**

* Transaction ID

* Date of purchase

* Customer demographics (Age, Gender)

* Product Category

* Quantity sold

* Price per unit

* Total sales amount




## Key Questions💭

* Which product categories generate the _highest revenue and sales volume_?

* How do _sales change_ across different months?

* Are there product categories with _unstable or highly variable demand_?

* What patterns can help improve _inventory planning_?



## Initial Findings

* Certain product categories contribute significantly more to total revenue despite lower sales volume.

* Monthly analysis shows noticeable fluctuations in sales, indicating seasonal patterns.

* Some product categories exhibit high demand variability, making them less predictable and harder to manage.

* Stable product categories show consistent sales across months, making them easier to plan for.



## Business Recommendations📲

* Prioritize consistent restocking for high-revenue and stable-demand product categories.

* Apply demand forecasting techniques to categories with high variability to minimize inventory risk.

* Align inventory planning with identified seasonal sales trends.

* Monitor underperforming categories for potential pricing or stocking adjustments.

* Use historical sales patterns as a foundation for future AI-driven inventory optimization.
